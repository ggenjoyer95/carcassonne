# PostgreSQL Implementation Status

This document tracks the status of PostgreSQL database implementation for each method in the game controller.

## Current Implementation Status

| Method | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| createGame | ✅ Implemented | Game creation is stored in the database |
| joinGame | ✅ Implemented | Player joining is stored in the database |
| startGame | ⏳ Pending | Needs to be updated to use the database |
| getGameState | ✅ Implemented | Game state is retrieved from the database |
| leaveGame | ⏳ Pending | Needs to be updated to use the database |
| makeMove | ⏳ Pending | Needs to be updated to use the database |
| placeTile | ⏳ Pending | Needs to be updated to use the database |
| endTurn | ⏳ Pending | Needs to be updated to use the database |
| placeDot | ⏳ Pending | Needs to be updated to use the database |
| rotateImage | ⏳ Pending | Needs to be updated to use the database |

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing the remaining methods, follow these guidelines:

1. Use the `Game.findById()` method to retrieve game data from the database
2. Update game state in memory
3. Use the `game.save()` method to persist changes to the database
4. Handle database errors appropriately

## Example Implementation Pattern

```javascript
const someMethod = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { gameId } = req.params;
    
    // Find game in database
    const game = await Game.findById(gameId);
    
    if (!game) {
      return res.status(404).json({ errorMessage: "Game not found" });
    }
    
    // Update game state
    // ...
    
    // Save changes to database
    await game.save();
    
    return res.status(200).json(game);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error in someMethod:", error);
    return res.status(500).json({ errorMessage: "Internal server error" });
  }
};
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement the `joinGame` method first, as it's typically the next step after creating a game
2. Then implement `getGameState` to ensure game state can be retrieved properly
3. Continue with `startGame` and the remaining methods
4. Add proper error handling and transaction support
5. Consider adding indexes to improve query performance
